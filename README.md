   - Create precise 3D models using parametric, feature-based design tools.
   - Easily modify designs by adjusting parameters.

2. **Assembly Design**:
   - Build complex assemblies with tools for component placement, motion simulation, and interference checking.
   - Use **Dynamic Simulation** to test how assemblies move and interact.

3. **Sheet Metal Design**:
   - Design sheet metal parts with specialized tools for flanges, bends, and punches.
   - Automatically generate flat patterns for manufacturing.

4. **Simulation and Analysis**:
   - Perform stress analysis, modal analysis, and thermal simulations using **Autodesk Nastran** or **Inventor Stress Analysis**.
   - Optimize designs for performance and manufacturability.

5. **Technical Documentation**:
   - Generate 2D drawings, bill of materials (BOM), and assembly instructions directly from 3D models.
   - Automatically update drawings when the model changes.

6. **Rendering and Visualization**:
   - Create realistic renderings and animations of your designs.
   - Use **Inventor Studio** for advanced visualization and presentation.

7. **Interoperability**:
